# GNNetSlice

GNNetSlice is a tool designed to predict the performance of network slices in the core network of 5G and Beyond 5G (B5G) systems. Network slicing is a crucial technology in modern telecommunications, allowing a single physical network to be virtualized into multiple virtual networks (slices). Each slice provides tailored Quality of Service (QoS) parameters such as latency, jitter, and loss, catering to specific use cases like Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communications (URLLC), massive Internet of Thincs (mIoT), and enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB).
